# Frontman

#### (Makers Academy Week 6 Test)

## Task 
Work on the front end of our Chitter application (week 4 test): 

* Skin the application (mainly css and html) so that it finally looks
decent.
* Make the whole front end work with javascript and a templating
system ( like handlebarsjs ) to enrich the experience. Make sure that
we only serve one html from our server that will initiate the
application.
* Create a JSON API on the server and make the front end talk to that
api ( you should create a path like so /api/peep etc ).
